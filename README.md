# Calculate Kfunctions from Lroot_calculated_irradiances.csv file

This is a Python script to obtain the diffuse attenuation coefficients (Kfunctions) from Lroot_calculated_irradiances.csv file. 
Source: https://github.com/Carlos-Rodero/calculate-irradiances-Hydrolight

This script calculate Kd as the diffuse attenuation coefficient of downwelling irradiance, Ku as the diffuse attenuation coefficient of upwelling irradiance and Kl as the diffuse attenuation coefficient of lateral-welling irradiance

## Instructions

- Copy your Lroot_calculated_irradiances.csv file obtained in this script:
https://github.com/Carlos-Rodero/calculate-irradiances-Hydrolight 
inside the files/raw folder
- Results appear in files/csv folder
